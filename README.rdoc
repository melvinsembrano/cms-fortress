== Installation

Add gem defintion to your Gemfile:

  gem 'cms-fortress'

Then from the Rails project's root run:

    bundle install
    rails generate cms:fortress
    rake db:migrate

After that run your app and navigate to http://localhost:3000/cms-admin to start creating your pages, and also don't forget to delete your public/index.html file.

    login using the following info below:

    username: admin@cmsfortress.com
    password: 1234qwer

===Adding custom role details

You can create a custom role ability via a three-step process.

1: Edit <tt>config/roles.yml</tt> and add the new role under the category you wish.

    contents:
      - pages
      - files
      - page.review
      - page.publish
    designs:
      - layouts
      - snippets
    settings:
      - sites
      - roles
      - users
      - *my_role_detail*

2: Configure cms-fortress to add a new resource. Add this in an initializer:

    Cms::Fortress.configure do |config|
      config.settings_resources << {
        :name => 'my_role_detail',
        :title => 'i18n.label.title', # this is passed to the t() function - can be plain text
        :path => 'admin_my_role_details_path'
      }
      # the other two lists are "content_resources" and "design_resources"
    end

The path is eval'd at runtime, so you can use Rails helper methods such as
+current_user+ or <tt>@site</tt> in it. If the result is nil, the link will not show up
in the left nav bar.

3: Restart the server. Go into each Role you have defined and click
"Load New Roles". Voila!

=== Other configuration

You can turn off page workflow or page caching via configuration:

    Cms::Fortress.configure do |config|
      config.enable_page_workflow = false
      config.enable_page_caching = false
    end

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
